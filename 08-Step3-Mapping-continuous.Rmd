# Step 3: Mapping continuous soil properties

In this chapter, the cleaned soil data and the previously downloaded covariate layers are used to generate soil property maps using DSM techniques. These consist of merging soil and environmental covariates data, selecting the covariates, calibrating the machine learning model, assessing the uncertainty, predicting the soil properties and finally export the maps.

## Getting prepared to map

To begin, we open *RStudio* and empty our global environment. Then, we set the working directory and assign the file path to our AOI shapefile to an R object. The target soil property that is going to be mapped in this exercise is Potassium denoted as 'k' in the soil data table. Next, an R function that was built by the GSP is loaded from the training material folder. Finally, the packages that are going to be needed for mapping are called. 

```{r, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}

Since soil data and environmental covariates are stored in different files and formats, it is necessary to first merge them into one dataframe. For this purpose, the covariate raster files are loaded into **R** from the covariates folder. Secondly, the table with the cleaned and quality checked soil data is loaded and converted to a shapefile using the lat/long coordinates columns.

```{r, eval = F, message = F, warning = F}
# 1 - Merge soil data with environmental covariates ============================

## 1.1 - Load covariates -------------------------------------------------------
files <- list.files(path= '01-Data/covs/', pattern = '.tif$', full.names = T)
ncovs <- list.files(path= '01-Data/covs/', pattern = '.tif$', full.names = F)
#In case of extent error, or if covariates other than the default ones are added
# ref <- rast(files[1])
# covs <- list()
# for (i in seq_along(files)) {
#   r <- rast(files[i])
#   r <- project(r, ref)
#   covs[[i]] <- r
# }
# covs <- rast(covs)

covs  <- rast(files)
ncovs <- filename <- names(covs)

new_nm  <- c("dtm_neg", "dtm_pos")
var <- c("dtm_neg_openness_250m", "dtm_pos_openness_250m")
idx <- sapply(var, function(x) grep(x, names(covs)))
names(covs)[idx] <- new_nm

## 1.2 - Load the soil data (Script 2) -----------------------------------------
dat <- read_csv("Digital-Soil-Mapping/02-Outputs/harmonized_soil_data.csv")

# Convert soil data into a spatial object (check https://epsg.io/6204)
dat <- vect(dat, geom=c("x", "y"), crs = crs(covs))



```

The shapefile can be reprojected to match the CRS of the covariates using the project function of the terra package. 
```{r, eval = F}
# Reproject point coordinates to match coordinate system of covariates
dat <- terra::project(dat, covs)
names(dat)
```

Afterwards, the extract function can be used to extract the values of each covariate raster layer at the point location of each soil profile. This data is then merged in the dat dataframe. After checking the descriptive statistics of dat with the `summary()` command, the target soil attribute is selected together with the covariates. Finally, NA values (empty row values) are removed using the `na.omit()` function.

```{r, eval = F}
## 1.3 - Extract values from covariates to the soil points ---------------------
pv <- terra::extract(x = covs, y = dat, xy = F)
dat <- as.data.frame(dat) |> 
  cbind(dat,pv)
summary(dat)
```

## Covariate selection and repeated k-fold cross-validation

Cross validation is one of the most used methods in DSM for assessing the overall accuracy of the resulting maps. Since this is implemented along with the model calibration step, we explain the process at this stage. Cross validation consists of randomly splitting the input data into a training set and a testing set. However, a unique testing dataset can bias the overall accuracy. Therefore, k-fold cross validation randomly splits the data into k parts, using 1/k part of it for testing and k-1/k part for training the model. In order to make the final model more robust in terms of parameter estimations, we include repetitions of this process. The final approach is called repeated k-fold cross-validation, where k will be equal to ten in this process (see Figure \@ref(fig:workflow1). A graphical representation of the 10-fold cross validation is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cv). Note that green balls represent the samples belonging to the testing set and yellow balls are samples of the training set. Each row is a splitting step of the 10-folds, while each block (repetitions) represent the repetition step.

```{r cv, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Schematic representation of the repeated cross-validation process."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv.png")
```

The cross-validation is repeated and after every iteration, i.e. each single splitting step (the rows in Figure \@ref(fig:cv)), the training data is used to calibrate the model, which will be explained in the next paragraph. The testing data will be used with the calibrated model to produce the residuals that play a role in assessing the uncertainty at a later stage (see Figure \@ref(fig:workflow1). 
Repeated cross validation has been nicely implemented in the caret R package [@Kuhn2022], along with several calibration methods. Here, we use the rfeControl() function to specify the modalities of the cross-validation that contain the abovementioned settings. These settings are stored in an object called "fitControl". Next, the user has to specify a formula that will be used in a regression. In line with the purpose of mapping the target soil property, the formula has Potassium as target variable (dependent variable) and all covariates as independent or explanatory variables.



```{r, eval = F}
for(soilatt in unique(target_properties)){


## 1.4 - Target soil attribute + covariates ------------------------------------
d <- dat |> 
  dplyr::select(soc_0_30, bio1:slope)
d <- na.omit(d)

# 2 - Covariate selection with RFE =============================================
## 2.1 - Setting parameters ----------------------------------------------------
# Repeatedcv = 3-times repeated 10-fold cross-validation
fitControl <- rfeControl(functions = rfFuncs,
                         method = "repeatedcv",
                         number = 10,         ## 10 -fold CV
                         repeats = 3,        ## repeated 3 times
                         verbose = TRUE,
                         saveDetails = TRUE, 
                         returnResamp = "all")

# Set the regression function
fm = as.formula(paste(soilatt," ~", paste0(ncovs,
                                             collapse = "+")))

# Calibrate the model using multiple cores
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores()-1)
registerDoParallel(cl)


```

The following step requires high computational power. To optimise the use of the computing power available on your device, parallel computing is activated that optimises the use of the available cores on your device. Then, the model is calibrated and only the covariates that actually have an effect on the target soil property are selected. This is an important step to avoid overfitting of the model that can hamper a model's capacity to predict.
The model calibration is done using a recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. Here, a model that contains all covariates as predictors is subsequently reduced to a more parsimonious model.

```{r, eval = F}
## 2.2 - Calibrate a RFE model to select covariates ----------------------------
covsel <- rfe(fm,
              data = d,  
              sizes = seq(from=10, to=length(ncovs)-1, by = 5),
              rfeControl = fitControl,
              verbose = TRUE,
              keep.inbag = T)
stopCluster(cl)
saveRDS(covsel, "Digital-Soil-Mapping/02-Outputs/models/covsel.rda")
```

The selected covariates can be visualised in Trellis displays. Finally, the optimal predictors are stored in a dedicated R object.

```{r, eval = T, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
covsel <- readRDS("Digital-Soil-Mapping/02-Outputs/models/covsel.rda")
soilatt <- "k_0_30"
```


```{r, eval = T}
## 2.3 - Plot selection of covariates ------------------------------------------
trellis.par.set(caretTheme())
plot(covsel, type = c("g", "o"))

# Extract selection of covariates and subset covs
opt_covs <- predictors(covsel)

```

An alternative feature selection approach is to use the Boruta R package.

```{r Boruta}
library(Boruta)

# run the Boruta algorithm
fs_bor <- Boruta(y = d$soc_0_30, x = d[-1], maxRuns = 35, doTrace = 1)

# plot variable importance and selected features
plot(fs_bor)

# plot evolution of the feature selection
plotImpHistory(fs_bor)

# extract the selected feature variables
fs_vars <- getSelectedAttributes(fs_bor)

# view summary of the results
View(attStats(fs_bor))
```


## Model calibration

The model calibration step involves the use of a statistical model to find the relations between soil observations and environmental covariates. One of the most widely used models in DSM is random forest [@Breiman2001]. Random forest is considered a machine learning method which belongs to the decision-tree type of model. Random forest creates an ensemble of trees using a random selection of covariates. The prediction of a single tree is made based on the observed samples mean in the leaf. The random forest prediction is made by taking the average of the predictions of the single trees. The size of the number of covariates at each tree (mtry) can be fine-tuned before calibrating the model. 
Quantile regression forests (QRF, @Meinshausen2006) are a generalisation of the random forest models, capable of not only predicting the conditional mean, but also the conditional probability density function. This feature allows one to estimate the standard deviation of the prediction, as well as the likelihood of the target variable falling below a given threshold. In a context where a minimum level of a soil nutrient concentration may be decisive for improving the crop yield, this feature can play an important role for the GSNmap initiative. 
Model calibration will be implemented using the caret package [@Kuhn2022]. While we suggest to use QRF, caret provides a large set of models https://topepo.github.io/caret/available- models.html#) that might perform better in specific cases. In this regard, it is up to the user to implement a different model, ensuring  the product specifications (Section Product Specifications).

In the previous step, the number of covariates was reduced based on a 10-fold cross-validation that was repeated three times based on a regression model. To account for the reduced number of covariates, the model formula is updated at first.
Again, parallel computing is used to speed up the computational process.
The cross-validation is repeated with the new formula and different numbers of covariates (mtry) at each tree are assessed. After optimising this parameter, a QRF model is calibrated using the caret package.

```{r, eval = F}
# 3 - QRF Model calibration ====================================================
## 3.1 - Update formula with the selected covariates ---------------------------
fm <- as.formula(paste(soilatt," ~", paste0(opt_covs, collapse = "+")))

# parallel processing
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores()-1)
registerDoParallel(cl)

## 3.2 - Set training parameters -----------------------------------------------
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                           number = 10,         ## 10 -fold CV
                           repeats = 3,        ## repeated 3 times
                           savePredictions = TRUE)

# Tune mtry hyperparameters
mtry <- round(length(opt_covs)/3)
tuneGrid <-  expand.grid(mtry = c(mtry-5, mtry, mtry+5))

## 3.3 - Calibrate the QRF model -----------------------------------------------
model <- caret::train(fm,
                      data = d,
                      method = "qrf",
                      trControl = fitControl,
                      verbose = TRUE,
                      tuneGrid = tuneGrid,
                      keep.inbag = T,
                      importance = TRUE)
stopCluster(cl)
gc()

```

The results have been stored in an R object called model. To assess the contribution of each covariate on the model prediction, relative importances expressed in percent are extracted. Finally, the model output is saved in the model folder within the Outputs folder - specifying the target soil properties. 

```{r, eval = F}
## 3.4 - Extract predictor importance as relative values (%)
x <- randomForest::importance(model$finalModel)
model$importance <- x
## 3.5 - Print and save model --------------------------------------------------
print(model)
saveRDS(model, file = paste0("02-Outputs/models/model_",soilatt,".rds"))

```

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
model <- readRDS(file = paste0("Digital-Soil-Mapping/02-Outputs/models/model_","k_0_30",".rds"))
print(model)
```


An alternative approach is to use the ranger R package with the quantreg argument set to TRUE. The results of which are much faster, since ranger is already parallelized internally.

```{r ranger}
## Set training parameters -----------------------------------------------
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                           number = 10,         ## 10 -fold CV
                           repeats = 3,        ## repeated 3 times
                           savePredictions = TRUE)

# Tune mtry hyperparameters
mtry <- round(length(fs_bor)/3)
tuneGrid <-  expand.grid(
  mtry = abs(c(mtry-5, mtry, mtry+5)),
  min.node.size = c(1, 5, 10),
  splitrule = c("variance", "extratrees", "maxstat", "beta")
  )

## 3.2.3 - Calibrate the QRF model -----------------------------------------------
model_rn <- caret::train(
  y = d$soc_0_30, x = d[-1],
  method = "ranger",
  quantreg = TRUE,
  importance = "permutation",
  trControl = fitControl,
  verbose = TRUE,
  tuneGrid = tuneGrid
  )


## 3.2.4 - Extract predictor importance as relative values (%)
x <- model_rn$finalModel$variable.importance
model_rn$importance <- x
## 3.2.5 - Print and save model --------------------------------------------------
print(model_rn)
saveRDS(model_rn, file = paste0("02-Outputs/models/model_rn_",soilatt,".rds"))

```


## Uncertainty assessment
Accuracy assessment is an essential step in digital soil mapping. One aspect of the accuracy assessment has been done in Step 7 by predicting the standard deviation of the prediction, which shows the spatial pattern of the uncertainty. Another aspect of the uncertainty is the estimation of the overall accuracy to measure the model performance. This will be measured using the model residuals generated by caret during the repeated cross validation step.
The residuals produced by caret consist of tabular data with observed and predicted values of the target soil property. They can be used to estimate different accuracy statistics. @Wadoux2022 have reviewed and evaluated many of them. While they concluded that there is not a single accuracy statistic that can explain all aspect of map quality, they recommended the following:

The average error indices all relate to the difference between observed (z) and predicted (&#7825;) value of soil property *S* at the location *i*. The error \epsilon is thus defined as:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon(S_{i}) = z(S_{i}) - \hat{z}(S_{i})
\end{equation}

The error indices that can be derived from this calculation inform about different aspects of prediction error and have the same unit as the target soil property. The mean prediction error (ME) estimates the prediction bias (see Eq. \@ref(eq:me)). If the ME is negative it means that the predicted values are below the observed ones. Conversely, a positive ME indicates a bias of the model towards higher predictions.

\begin{equation} 
  ME = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\epsilon(S_{i})
  (\#eq:me)
\end{equation}

Mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean squared error (RMSE) estimate the magnitude of errors. The MAE takes the absolute value of the ME thus quantifies the overall magnitude of the prediction error (see Eq.\@ref(eq:mae)). The closer the MAE is to 0 the more accurate is the model prediction.

\begin{equation} 
  MAE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\epsilon(S_{i})|
  (\#eq:mae)
\end{equation}

Also, the RMSE provides a measure of the prediction error. Ideally, the RMSE approximates 0. Due to the squaring, larger absolute errors become more important (see Eq. \@ref(eq:rmse)). Thus, high absolute errors may lead to a worse RMSE measure. Therefore, it is best to calculate all three error indices to get a comprehensive picture.

\begin{equation} 
  RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\epsilon(S_{i})^{2}}
  (\#eq:rmse)
\end{equation}

Besides the error indices, model quality can also be expressed by the coefficient of determination (R^2^) which is the squared Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r) (see Eq. \@ref(eq:r2)). The R^2^ takes values between 0 and 1. An R^2^ of 1 indicates total correlation between predicted and observed values whereas 0 indicates no correlation. The R^2^ can be biased by several factors and thus needs to be combined with other measures to yield a complete picture [@Wadoux2022]. 

\begin{equation} 
  r^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z(S_{i})-\overline{z})(\hat{z}(S_{i})-\overline{z})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z(S_{i})-\overline{z})^2}\sqrt{\hat{z}(S_{i})-\overline{\hat{z}})^2}}
  (\#eq:r2)
\end{equation}

The Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r) can take values between -1 and 1 and thus indicate the direction of the correlation (see Eq. \@ref(eq:r)).

\begin{equation} 
  r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z(S_{i})-\overline{z})(\hat{z}(S_{i})-\overline{z})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z(S_{i})-\overline{z})^2}\sqrt{\hat{z}(S_{i})-\overline{\hat{z}})^2}}
  (\#eq:r)
\end{equation}

The modelling efficiency coefficient (MEC) accounts for the proportion of variance that is explained by a model [@Janssen1995]. It is calculated as the ratio of the RMSE and the variance (squared standard deviation) (see Eq. \@ref(eq:mec)). In a perfect scenario, the MEC equals 1. If the MEC equals 0, it means that the model does not predict the values better than the mean of the observed values would. In addition to that, the MEC can also take negative values if the RMSE is greater than the variance. In consequence, negative MECs indicate that the model predicts the values worse than the mean of the observed values.

\begin{equation} 
  MEC = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z(S_{i})-\hat{z}(S_{i}))^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z(S_{i})-\overline{z})^2}
  (\#eq:mec)
\end{equation}

The R^2^, RMSE, and the MEC are susceptible to bias through large error values. Thus, caution needs to be taken when interpreting the indices presented here for accuracy assessment.

Now, back to the mapping exercise: In practical terms, before calculating any of these indices, it is necessary to first extract observed and predicted values and then store them in two separate R objects. Next, both values are combined to a dataframe.


```{r, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
# 4 - Uncertainty assessment ===================================================
# extract observed and predicted values
o <- model$pred$obs
p <- model$pred$pred
df <- data.frame(o,p)
```

While solar diagrams [@Wadoux2022] are desired, we propose to produce a scatterplot of the observed vs predicted values maintaining the same range and scale for the X and Y axes. The dataframe is used for this purpose to plot observed values on the x-axis and predicted values on the y-axis.

```{r, eval = T, message = F}
## 4.1 - Plot and save scatterplot --------------------------------------------- 
(g1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = o, y = p)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
   geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red")+
  ylim(c(min(o), max(o))) + theme(aspect.ratio=1)+ 
  labs(title = soilatt) + 
  xlab("Observed") + ylab("Predicted"))
# ggsave(g1, filename = paste0("02-Outputs/residuals_",soilatt,".png"), scale = 1, 
#        units = "cm", width = 12, height = 12)


```


Additionally, it is necessary to calculate standard metrics of error estimation. The function eval() below returns values for the ME, RMSE, MAE, the squared pearson correlation coefficient, the concordance correlation coefficient, scale shift and location shift relative to scale.

```{r, eval = T}
## 4.2 - Print accuracy coeficients --------------------------------------------
# https://github.com/AlexandreWadoux/MapQualityEvaluation
eval(p,o)
```

Finally, a variable importance plot is generated to visualise the relative importance of each covariate/predictor.

```{r, eval = F, message = F}
## 4.3 - Plot Covariate importance ---------------------------------------------
(g2 <- varImpPlot(model$finalModel, main = soilatt, type = 1))


vip::vip(model_rn$finalModel)


# png(filename = paste0("02-Outputs/importance_",soilatt,".png"), 
#     width = 15, height = 15, units = "cm", res = 600)
# g2
# dev.off()
```

```{r, eval = T, echo = F, message=F}
g2 <- varImpPlot(model$finalModel, main = soilatt, type = 1)
g2
```


Finally, note that accuracy assessment has been discussed in @Wadoux2021, since the spatial distribution of soil samples might constrain the validity of the accuracy statistics. This is especially true in cases where the spatial distribution of observations is clustered. The authors recommended creating a kriging map of residuals before using them for assessing the map quality.

## Predicting soil attributes

After calibrating the model, caret will select the best set of parameters and will fit the model using the whole dataset. Then, the final model can be used to predict the target soil properties. The process uses the model and the values of the covariates at target locations. This is generally done by using the same input covariates as a multilayer raster format, ensuring that the names of the layers are the same as the covariates in the calibration dataset. In this step we will predict the conditional mean and conditional standard deviation at each raster cell.

First, the raster is split into so-called tiles that divide the whole area of interest in multiple rasters with a coarse resolution. In this case 25 tiles are produced (5 rows x 5 columns). The functions for tiling come from the terra package.

```{r, eval = F}
# 5 - Prediction ===============================================================
# Generation of maps (prediction of soil attributes) 
## 5.1 - Produce tiles ---------------------------------------------------------
r <-covs[[1]]
t <- rast(nrows = 5, ncols = 5, extent = ext(r), crs = crs(r))
tile <- makeTiles(r, t,overwrite=TRUE,filename="02-Outputs/tiles/tiles.tif")


```

Next, a for loop is formulated to predict each soil attribute for each tile. The tiling significantly improves the computational speed of the prediction. For each tile the mean and the standard deviation are stored in two separated objects that are then saved as raster files.

```{r, eval = F}
## 5.2 - Predict soil attributes per tiles -------------------------------------
# loop to predict on each tile

for (j in seq_along(tile)) {
  gc()
  t <- rast(tile[j])
  covst <- crop(covs, t)
  
  
  # plot(r)# 
  pred_mean <- terra::predict(covst, model = model$finalModel, na.rm=TRUE,  
                              cpkgs="quantregForest", what=mean)
  pred_sd <- terra::predict(covst, model = model$finalModel, na.rm=TRUE,  
                            cpkgs="quantregForest", what=sd)  
  
  
  
  # ###### Raster package solution (in case terra results in many NA pixels)
  # library(raster)
  # covst <- stack(covst)
  # class(final_mod$finalModel) <-"quantregForest"
  # # Estimate model uncertainty
  # pred_sd <- predict(covst,model=final_mod$finalModel,type=sd)
  # # OCSKGMlog prediction based in all available data
  # pred_mean <- predict(covst,model=final_mod)
  # 
  # 
  # ##################################  
  
  writeRaster(pred_mean, 
              filename = paste0("02-Outputs/tiles/soilatt_tiles/",
                                soilatt,"_tile_", j, ".tif"), 
              overwrite = TRUE)
  writeRaster(pred_sd, 
              filename = paste0("02-Outputs/tiles/soilatt_tiles/",
                                soilatt,"_tileSD_", j, ".tif"), 
              overwrite = TRUE)
  
  rm(pred_mean)
  rm(pred_sd)
  
  
  print(paste("tile",tile[j]))
}
```

As a result, 25 tiles for the predicted mean and 25 tiles for the predicted standard deviation were produced using the QRF model. The next step is to merge these tiles to produce a map of the predicted mean and one of the predicted standard deviation. For this, again for loops are employed that read all raster file tiles. These are then put together by the mosaic() function of the terra package. Finally, they are masked to the AOI and then can be visualised in a figure.

```{r, eval = F}
## 5.3 - Merge tiles both prediction and st.Dev --------------------------------
f_mean <- list.files(path = "02-Outputs/tiles/soilatt_tiles/",

The final step then consists of applying a cropland mask that is applied to the map and the uncertainty map since the soil data comes only from croplands and thus no assumption can be made to soil property values under different land covers. Additionally, a map is calculated to visualise the coefficient of variation (in Percent). The maps are then stored as raster files (GeoTiff/.tif) in the Outputs folder.
